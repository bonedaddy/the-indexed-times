The Indexed Times is an unofficial monthly newsletter that provides information about the Indexed Finance protocol. We'll include Technical Analysis of the indices and their pooled assets, developments in the community, new governance proposals, and anything else related to Indexed Finance. To signup please fill out the following form and tick the box next to "index mailing list" followed clicking "Subscribe" after which you'll receive a confirmation email. If you dont receive a confirmation please make sure you check your spam folders or other similar folders.

By subscribing to this newsletter the only information we collect about you is the given email, and whatever name you provide; We will not sell this information to any third-parties. All emails received will not contain any sort of tracking pixels, or any kind of tracking links. That being said we may link to off-site content say for example a blog post by a community member, or the website of a project building ontop of Indexed Finance. Those websites may collect information however we have absolutely no control over that.

You can opt out from receiving further emails at any time when you receive one of our newsletters by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the footer which is included in all emails we send out. The newsletter will always remain free and contain the same kind of information, however a premium version will eventually be available for a monthly fee that includes more advanced technical analysis and the ability to receive email notifications when certain price thresholds are met.
